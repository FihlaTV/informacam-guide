## 3 Things You Can Quickly Do With CameraV

1) Take pictures or video with synchronized sensor metadata capture for later use in verification, analysis, proof or other “blackbox” purposes.

2) Notarize captured photos and videos by sharing the unique ID and sensor metadata through email, SMS or social media.

3) Share photos and videos privately or publicly with the sensor metadata embedded in the media, for later verification and use.

## Taking a Photo or Video With Sensor Metadata

The CameraV sensors automatically activate when you start capture. You can optionally enable Location, Bluetooth and Wifi services in your Android Settings to allow the app to use those sensors.
