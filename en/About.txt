## TRUST (BUT VERIFY!) WHAT YOUR EYES SEE

InformaCam is a system that uses the built-in sensors in modern smartphones for tracking movement, light and other environmental inputs, along with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular network information to capture a snapshot of the environment around you, while you are taking a photo or video. This extra metadata (the data about the data!) helps verify and validate the date, time and location of capture, and provides an entirely new layer of context and meaning out of "invisible" energy for use in any way you choose. Finally digital signatures and encryption ensure that your media hasn't been tampered with since capture and that it can only be seen by the people you choose.

Currently, you can use InformaCam by installing the CameraV app for Android smartphones. CameraV uses V for Verification, Veritas (Truth!) and Vaulted (secured!). It is also evokes the "V" hand sign for victory and peace.
