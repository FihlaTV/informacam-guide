# Chapter 11: Security Features

This chapter will give you an overview of all the security features of CameraV and the InformaCam system in one place.

## Storage Encryption

CameraV contains a fully encrypted storage capability, that appears as a single file on the device storage. It uses the IOCipher virtual file system for this, and enables metadata and metadata to be direclty stored in encrypted format, without ever being stored in the clear on the device. This is important, since once you store something unencrypted on a mobile device, you open it up to being copied or intercepted by other apps, or being forensically recovered at a future time. 

Photos and videos are only encrypted if you use CameraV's built-in encrypted camera capability, and not external camera apps. Import of unencrypted media into the encrypted storage is not currently supported or ideal.

## App Locking via Passphrase

As part of the encrypted storage, the app supports locking access to itself and data behind a passphrase. When you first open the app after a device start, you will be required to enter the passphrase you chose on setup. The app should then remain unlocked until you manually lock the app, or restart your device.

## Media and Metadata Signing via PGP

CameraV includes built-in OpenPGP (Pretty Good Privacy) capabilities for signing and encryption of data. All metadata is signed by the private key of the user that is generated during the app setup. This signature data is included in the J3M document when you export it. 

It is also possible for entire metadata documents to be encrypted for sharing to a remote recipient, but this requires a specific "trusted profile" to be configured and setup.

## Media Hash Generation

SHA-1 hashes are generated for each media file, and included in the exported J3M documents. This hash is also used as the visual media fingerprint for the notarization process.
